Maybe we not have done c.eq.s etc. :
For treating types as booleans (like when using the || operator), you can just compare it with 0 in a normal register (except when a float value is -0.0). A value is false if all its bits are zero. The type doesnâ€™t matter.

1. if(float a)


int a=5;
	int *x=&a;
	*x=*x+1;
	cout<<a<<endl;
